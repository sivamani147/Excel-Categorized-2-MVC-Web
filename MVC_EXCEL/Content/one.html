        Altria and each of its companies strive for a workplace culture in which each employee works
        toward the goal of an injury free career. Each Altria company is committed to the prevention of
        workplace injuries and illnesses and to compliance with applicable laws and company policies related to
        employee safety and health.

        In support of our commitment toward an Injury-Free Career culture we will:

        1. Encourage all employees to work toward an injury free career by demonstrating safe
        behaviors, following established safety protocols, communicating solutions to hazards,
        and by watching out for those they work with every day.

        2. Integrate safety into our business plans and total quality processes. Allocate and organize
        resources to ensure successful implementation.

        3. Design safety into the workplace. Continue to employ safe technologies and operating
        procedures.

        4. Require all employees to share the responsibility for participating in accident
        prevention, and for reporting and improving upon conditions that may pose safety and
        health risks.

        5. Continually improve safety education, training and awareness.

        6. Communicate any known or suspected safety hazards associated with our operations to all
        employees, contractors and other necessary personnel.

        7. Require adherence to sound accident prevention and mandatory compliance
        practices. Enforce compliance through a clearly communicated and consistently applied
        disciplinary policy.

        8. Evaluate safety performance based on activities or processes that lead to measurable
        results. Integrate into performance measurement and continuous improvement
        systems.

        9. Continually improve our safety systems and programs by auditing and correcting the root
        cause of deficiencies.

        10. Inspect and monitor workplace conditions. Investigate all incidents including near misses,
        not just accidents.
